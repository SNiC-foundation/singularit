This begs the question: what does this all mean for cyber security? Are the threats changing together with the nature of technology, or are old problems just resurfacing in new domains? Dr. Melanie Rieback, CEO of Radically Open Security, former Assistant Professor at the Free University of Amsterdam, and cybersecurity lecturer for Singularity University will share her thoughts on the matter.</p></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Dr. Melanie Rieback is the CEO/Co-founder of Radically Open Security, the world’s first non-profit computer security consultancy company.

In the last few decades there has been an explosion in data collected regarding cities, whether it's the mobility and interaction of the people, or data regarding the infrastructure and growth of the city. This new data offers huge opportunity to develop new scientific understanding and new theories of cities, but at the same time the blind use of data can lead to problems. When used properly, this data, along with computational models, can help develop solutions to some of the problems faced by (rapidly) growing cities. In this talk I will address some of the latest data-driven methods used to understand cities. For example, what can universal scaling laws of cities tell us about why we have cities. I will then highlight some of the ongoing work we are doing in Amsterdam and India where we develop computational models to help understand various urban and city-level phenomena.</p></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Dr Michael Lees is an Assistant Professor at the Universiteit van Amsterdam in the Computational Science Lab (Informatics Institute). He currently conducts regular research visits to Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. At the University of Amsterdam he is the Director for the Master Computational Science. He studied for his PhD in Nottingham University, UK and his BSc in Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence from Edinburgh University. His current research interests are primarily in modelling and simulation of large scale social and urban complex systems. I'm particularly interested in understanding the effect that human behaviour and decision making has on such systems and the important role that individual behavioural interactions have on system level dynamics. His current projects try to understand the growth and dynamics of informal settlements, the dynamics of human crowds and the growth of electric vehicles in Amsterdam and Singapore. He has served as an editor for the journal of computational science, and the ACM Transactions on Modelling and Computer Simulation.</p></div></div><hr/><span class="speaker-anchor" id="cees"></span><div class="session"><h3>Cees Snoek</h3><p class="cees"></p><div class="speaker-image-container"><img class="speaker-image" src="/images/sprekers/cees.png"/></div><h5>Video Understanding from a Sentence</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">By 2022 there will be 45 billion cameras in the world, many of them tiny, connected and live streaming 24/7. Self-driving cars, drones and service robots are just three manifestations. For all these applications it will be of critical importance to understand what is happening where and when in the video streams. This foreseen capability not only raises challenging technological questions, but also warrants serious ethical considerations with respect to data ownership, privacy protection, and the role of automated decision making. This talk provides an overview of the opportunities and threads that video understanding may provide, and illustrates new algorithms for spatiotemporal video understanding. The common tactic to spatiotemporal video understanding is to track a human-specified box or to learn a deep classification network from a set of predefined action classes. In this talk I will present an alternative approach, that allows for spatiotemporal recognition from a natural language sentence as input, and show its utility for object tracking and behavior recognition. For both tasks we discuss the realization via multimodal network architectures and sentence-augmented datasets, comparisons with the traditional state-of-the-art, as well as their potential for application in surveillance and other live video streams.</p></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Cees Snoek is a full professor in computer science at the University of Amsterdam, where he heads the Intelligent Sensory Information Systems Lab.

But miniaturization makes chips vulnerable to undesirable quantum-mechanical effects that prevent them from behaving in the intended 'classical' way. Celebrated proposals of Feynman and Deutsch from the 1980s suggested that, instead of fighting these effects, we should use them to our advantage and design computers based on their principles, giving birth to the currently thriving field of quantum computing. In this talk I will introduce the basic ideas behind quantum information processing and discuss some of its most striking applications and phenomena.</p></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Jop Briët is a researcher at CWI (the national research center for mathematics and computer science). He obtained his PhD from CWI and the University of Amsterdam in 2011 and was a post-doc at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University on an NWO Rubicon Fellowship. His research lies in the intersection of theoretical computer science and mathematics, and often involves quantum algorithms, entanglement, coding theory, approximation algorithms, Banach spaces, and additive combinatorics. For his PhD thesis he was awarded the Stieltjes prize and the Andreas Bonn medal.

This genome directs the cell’s function and behaviour, superficially much like a computer program. Most of today’s biological science revolves around understanding the genetic program. These studies have been transformed by the emergence of genomics – the large-scale study of the genome. The key technology enabling this revolution is DNA sequencing, which will soon allow any organism’s genes to be studied at any time. In parallel, new technologies for editing the genome have recently been invented. In this talk, I will explore these developments, and discuss how they will become part of our future lives.</p></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Christiaan Henkel is a molecular biologist turned bioinformatician. He started off his scientific career with a PhD in Leiden on molecular computing: the implementation of abstract algorithms in biochemical ‘wetware’ (for example, DNA). Subsequently, he specialized in genomics, and for the past ten years has used DNA sequencing technologies to study a wide variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to snakes (and including quite a few fish species). Currently, he is a research scientist at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Oslo, where he leads studies on fish developmental biology. In addition, he continues to collaborate with Leiden-based companies Future Genomics Technologies and BaseClear on the tulip genome.</p></div></div><hr/><span class="speaker-anchor" id="richard"></span><div class="session"><h3>Richard Stallman</h3><p class="richard"></p><div class="speaker-image-container"><img class="speaker-image" src="/images/sprekers/richard.png"/></div><h5>Should we have more surveillance than the USSR?</h5><h5><a href="/speakers/video/richard"><i class="fa fa-film speaker-video-link-icon"></i>Watch the talk here.</a></h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Digital technology has enabled governments to impose surveillance that Stalin could only dream of, making it next to impossible to talk with a reporter undetected.
